That year, California had the 29th-highest child poverty rate among U.S. states and the District of Columbia. But a number of factors — an increase in immigration, a decline in well-paying manufacturing jobs, and diminished state resources after Proposition 13 — helped to steadily increase that rate starting in the 1980s; it peaked at 26 percent in 1995.|The child poverty rate fell below 20 percent in the early 2000s and hovered just above the U.S. average, but the most recent recession drove poverty rates up. In California the rate rose to 24 percent in 2012 before starting to decline. In 2014, California had the 18th highest child poverty rate in the U.S. Poverty rates do not reflect the higher cost of living in California."

By the 2010-11 school year, it had fallen to 38th, at $10,051 per student (in 2014 dollars). That figure excludes debt service, facilities and other non-instructional costs as outlined by the Common Core of Data survey; spending from federal, state and local sources of revenue are included.|It is often stated that California’s funding per student is among the lowest in the United States. This is true when a state’s cost of living is taken into account. California typically funds education at a level similar to Texas, even though the cost of operating a school in California is more similar to that of New York or Massachusetts, states where the cost is much higher.|National data on spending run several years behind the current year. The increases in student spending in California as a result of a temporary tax increase through Proposition 30 and a rebounding economy in the past several years are not yet reflected in the latest numbers."

A 2010 high school graduate from New York received $234,998 worth of school expenditures over 13 years of schooling (adjusted to 2014 dollars), compared with $87,925 spent on a graduate from Utah. In California, a high school graduate in 2010 received $131,804 in educational investment, about $16,000 shy of the national average and $100,000 less than a New York graduate.|This wasn’t always the case in California. A high school graduate in the 1982-83 school year experienced the funding stream before and after Proposition 13 was passed in 1978. An average of $87,142 was invested in that graduate, about $10,000 higher than the national average. However, the first child to graduate in a post-Proposition 13 funding world in the 1990-91 school year received $1,000 more than the national average. Two years later K-12 spending per student in California would dip below the national average and remain there through 2010-11, the year of the most current data.|To put it another way: California K-12 graduates in the 2010-11 school year had 51 percent more invested in them during their K-12 years than graduates in 1982-83, compared with an 89 percent increase in the national average over that same time.

California used to consistently remain in the upper right corner of this chart, with other high-income, high-spending states. But in the 1990s, the state slowed down its per-student investment in education; Texas also cut its spending.|Interesting note: This chart shows the volatile movements of Alaska in the 1970s and early 1980s, riding the oil industry’s boom and bust.

The chart shows the percentage of the total income of its residents a state spent on K-12 instruction, regardless of where the state got its education funding.|This chart clearly shows the consequences of Proposition 13 on education funding. The initiative limited increases in property taxes, and the losses weren’t totally offset by increases in other taxes. California, already below the national average, went from 39th in effort with 4.2 percent of state personal income devoted to education in 1970 to 43rd in 1978 with 3.83 percent. At its low point, California ranked 47th in effort in 1984 with 3.29 percent.|In California, the sales tax and a progressive personal income tax, which is highly dependent on the volatile income of the top 1 percent of earners, produce most of the revenue for the state budget. Proposition 98, passed in 1988, determines the minimum level of funding for education, and the Legislature has rarely exceeded that minimum. School districts have few options, other than a parcel tax, requiring a two-thirds vote, to raise additional money for schools."

The National Assessment of Educational Progress &mdash; or NAEP and sometimes called the “nation’s report card” &mdash; is administered to sample groups of students nationwide. It does allow for cross-state comparisons – with some caveats. Every two years NAEP math and reading tests are given in 4th and 8th grades. This chart compares states’ average proficiency rates in math and reading in both grades starting in 2003.|States set their own rules for how the NAEP test is administered, and those policies reduce the value of comparisons. For example, Texas exempts English learners who have had fewer than four years of English instruction. California administers the test to all students. California has consistently scored poorly on the NAEP, being among the 10 lowest-scoring states along with Louisiana, Mississippi and the District of Columbia since 2003. However, there was an uptick in 2013 in California's 8th-grade reading scores. California is also consistently below the national average.|Massachusetts has ranked No. 1 in NAEP scores since 2003."
