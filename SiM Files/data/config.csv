It also has one of the highest ratios of students to certificated personnel, which include resource teachers and special education teachers, along with classroom teachers. Student-teacher ratio is different from class size; the terms aren’t interchangeable.|Over time, most states have increased expenditures and reduced class sizes from 1970, when the student-teacher ratio was between 20:1 and 24:1. High-spending states like New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts and Rhode Island have increased teacher pay and reduced the overall student-certificated teacher ratio in the state. In many states, teacher pay has kept up with inflation but not increased substantially. California stands apart with relatively low funding per student and high teacher costs. The result is that California’s ratio of students to certificated teachers has remained among the highest in the nation."
