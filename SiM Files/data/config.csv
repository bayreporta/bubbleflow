California ranked 4th in per capita income in the mid-1970s but fell back during decades of rapid growth. As a result of the Great Recession, it ranked 12th in 2013 at $48,434 per person."

By 2013, it had fallen to the bottom third of states as measured by its “current expense” of $9,495 per student on education, a figure that excludes debt service, facilities and other costs.|It is often stated that California’s funding per student is near the lowest in the United States. This is true when a state’s cost of living is taken into account. California typically funds education at a level similar to Texas, even though the cost of operating a school in California is more similar to New York or Massachusetts. National data on spending run two and three years behind. The increases in student spending in California as a result of Proposition 30 and a rebounding economy in the past two years are not yet reflected in the latest numbers.|Student spending generally tracks per capita income, with the wealthier states spending more on education. That has been consistent for the past 40 years. However, there are exceptions. West Virginia, with a below average per capita income, was in the back of the pack in the ’70s, but by 1990 had passed California in spending."

A 2012 high school graduate from New York received $208,000 worth of school expenditures over 13 years of schooling, compared with $75,000 spent on a graduate from Utah. In California, the state spent an average of $112,000 on student’s education from kindergarten through 12th grade. 0f course, it’s less expensive to live in Utah, which pays teachers much less than California, and that is the main source of the difference in spending. This chart compares the aggregate spending differences among states over time, starting in 1983, when the students who entered kindergarten in 1970 would have completed 13 years of public education."

High-income, high-spending-per-student states like New York are in the upper right; low-income, low-spending states like Utah are in the lower left.

Effort,5,"Four decades ago, California and most states spent a bigger share of their taxable wealth on schools than today","Source: Bureau of Economic Analysis, Personal Income, and National Center for Education Statistics, Common Core of Data.",Line,effort,2,8,1970,2010,K-12 Expenditures Compared With Personal Income,,,,,,-120,,,7/8/2015,"Some states make a bigger “effort” to educate students, as defined by the proportion of a state's total personal income that it devotes to K-12 spending. In 1970, nearly every state spent at least 4 percent of its economy on schools; California’s share was 4.2 percent. Fifteen years later, California was spending 3.4 percent of its income on schools, in part reflecting a decline in school-age children. After rising to 3.8 percent in 2000, effort fell amid the Great Recession to 3.5 percent in 2010, ranked 40th in the nation. With a few exceptions, including West Virginia and Illinois, other states followed the same pattern."
NAEP,6,California students haven't done well on the National Assessment of Educational Progress,"Source: National Center for Educational Progress, Proficency in 4th and 8th Grades Reading and Math",Line,naep,0,60,1,6,Precent Proficient in 4th/8th Grade Math/Reading,,,,,,-120,,,7/8/2015,"While most state standardized tests are based on the states’ own academic standards, the National Assessment of Educational Progress, or NAEP, sometimes called the “nation’s report card,” is administered to sample groups of students nationwide. It does allow for cross-state comparisons – with some caveats. Every two years NAEP math and reading tests are given in grades 4 and 8. This chart compares states’ average proficiency rates in math and reading for grades 4th and 8th grades, starting in 2000. States set their own rules for how the NAEP test is administered, and those policies reduce the value of comparisons. For example, California administers the test to a sample of all students, but Texas’s sample exempts students with less than four years of English instruction. California has scored near the bottom of the NAEP,  along with Louisiana, Mississippi and the District of Columbia, although there was an uptick in 2013 in California's 8th grade reading scores. Massachusetts is the uncontested master of the NAEP, with the top scores."

States like Massachusetts, Vermont and New Hampshire tend to outscore states like California with relatively larger populations of low-income children. Nearly a quarter of California's children are English learners, and  the far majority of  them are poor, compounding the state's challenge and its low NAEP scores. In 2013, 29.5 percent of California's 4th and 8th grade students scored proficient, compared with 52 percent in Massachusetts."

It compares state spending per student, the vertical axis, and proficiency scores on the National Assessment of Educational Progress, or NAEP, the horizontal axis. High-spending Massachusetts led the way, but low-spending Colorado did as well as big spenders New Jersey and Maryland. And Utah, which spends far less, did better than New York. The District of Columbia, with a high proportion of low-income students, is a distinct outlier, with high spending and low test results. One factor alone does not drive student achievement. State policies, leadership and the equitable distribution of resources  matter at the state level; parental income and education matter, too. Per student spending is one factor in the mix."

But over the past 40-plus years, average teacher salaries have declined relative to a state's income per capita. The trend is sharpest in Midwestern states like the Dakotas and Wyoming.  In 1970, California teachers earned more than double the average per capita income in the state. By 2012, this had fallen to 46 percent more. In this chart, zero indicates that the average per capita income and average teacher's salary are identical."

It also has one of the highest ratios of students to certificated personnel, which include resource teachers and special education teachers, along with classroom teachers. Student-teacher ratio is different from class size; the terms aren’t interchangeable.|Over time, most states have increased expenditures and reduced class sizes from 1970, when the student-teacher ratio was between 20:1 and 24:1. High-spending states like New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts and Rhode Island have increased teacher pay and reduced the overall student-certificated teacher ratio in the state. In many states, teacher pay has kept up with inflation but not increased substantially. California stands apart with relatively low funding per student and high teacher costs. The result is that California’s ratio of students to certificated teachers has remained among the highest in the nation."
