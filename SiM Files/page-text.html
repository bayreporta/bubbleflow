<h1>States in Motion</h1>

<hr />

We have updated, expanded and simplified States in Motion, a series of  graphs and charts that explore and compare states' education-related data over time.

“States in Motion” explores 13  datasets, including National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) test scores, teacher salaries and student enrollments in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. In our update, we have included information on student poverty. The interstate comparisons provide answers to questions that include: How does California’s investment in public education compare with that of other states? How has that investment changed over the decades? How does the level of spending look when compared with datasets like a state’s per-capita income, proportion of students in poverty, teacher salaries and students-per-teacher? And what’s the correlation, if any, between state spending on education and student test scores as well as test scores and percentage of students in poverty?

Data for many of the charts go back to 1970; data on tests scores on the National Assessment of  Educational Progress or NAEP are more recent. Clicking the <em><strong>Download Data</strong></em> tab in the lower left of each chart will provide an Excel sheet containing the full data for the states by year.

We remain interested in hearing your suggestions for making States in Motion  more useful or understandable. You can also share your comments at the bottom of the page or send an <a href="mailto:edsourceweb@gmail.com">email.</a>

The project was conceived and developed by Jeff Camp, who made it available to EdSource for wider distribution and comment. Jeff chairs the education work of Full Circle Fund, a nonprofit volunteer organization with contributing members from all over the Bay Area. He is also designed <a class="external" href="http://ed100.org" target="_blank">Ed100</a>, which offers a set of primers about education in California; it's particularly useful for parents seeking a short course on the state's new funding and governing systems.

	California's child poverty rate grew steady in the 1980s to  more than 25 percent in the mid-1990s, reflecting both a rise in immigration and a decline of well-paying manufacturing jobs,  fell below 20 percent in the early 2000s, then rose to 21 percent in 2013, higher than 31 other states.

	Inflation-adjusted income per capita income has risen in all states, but some more than others. California ranked 4th in per capita income in the mid-1970s but fell back during decades of rapid growth. As a result of the Great Recession, it ranked 12th in 2013 at $48,434 per person.

	In 1977 — the year before the passage of Proposition 13, which severely restricted property tax levies—California’s per-student spending was the seventh highest in the nation. By 2013, it had fallen to the bottom third of states as measured by its “current expense” of $9,495 per student on education, a figure that excludes debt service, facilities and other costs.

	It is often stated that California’s funding per student is near the lowest in the United States. This is true when a state’s cost of living is taken into account. California typically funds education at a level similar to Texas, even though the cost of operating a school in California is more similar to New York or Massachusetts. National data on spending run two and three years behind. The increases in student spending in California as a result of Proposition 30 and a rebounding economy in the past two years are not yet reflected in the latest numbers.

	Student spending generally tracks per capita income, with the wealthier states spending more on education. That has been consistent for the past 40 years. However, there are exceptions. West Virginia, with a below average per capita income, was in the back of the pack in the ’70s, but by 1990 had passed California in spending.

	A state’s investment in 13 years of a student’s education is substantial, and so is the investment gap among states. A 2012 high school graduate from New York received $208,000 worth of school expenditures over 13 years of schooling, compared with $75,000 spent on a graduate from Utah. In California, the state spent an average of $112,000 on student’s education from kindergarten through 12th grade. 0f course, it’s less expensive to live in Utah, which pays teachers much less than California, and that is the main source of the difference in spending. This chart compares the aggregate spending differences among states over time, starting in 1983, when the students who entered kindergarten in 1970 would have completed 13 years of public education.

High-income, high-spending-per-student states like New York are in the upper right; low-spending states like Utah are in the lower left. Generally, states that have more to spend, spend more on kids’ education. Notice the volatile movements of Alaska, riding the oil industry’s boom and bust.

	Some states make a bigger “effort” to educate students, as defined by the proportion of a state's total personal income that it devotes to K-12 spending. In 1970, nearly every state spent at least 4 percent of its economy on schools; California’s share was 4.2 percent. Fifteen years later, California was spending 3.4 percent of its income on schools, in part reflecting a decline in school-age children. After rising to 3.8 percent in 2000, effort fell amid the Great Recession to 3.5 percent in 2010, ranked 40th in the nation. With a few exceptions, including West Virginia and Illinois, other states followed the same pattern.

	While most state standardized tests are based on the states’ own academic standards, the National Assessment of Educational Progress, or NAEP, sometimes called the “nation’s report card,” is administered to sample groups of students nationwide. It does allow for cross-state comparisons – with some caveats. Every two years NAEP math and reading tests are given in grades 4 and 8. This chart compares states’ average proficiency rates in math and reading for grades 4th and 8th grades, starting in 2000. States set their own rules for how the NAEP test is administered, and those policies reduce the value of comparisons. For example, California administers the test to a sample of all students, but Texas’s sample exempts students with less than four years of English instruction. California has scored near the bottom of the NAEP,  along with Louisiana, Mississippi and the District of Columbia, although there was an uptick in 2013 in California's 8th grade reading scores. Massachusetts is the uncontested master of the NAEP, with the top scores.

In 2013, 29.5 percent of California's 4th and 8th grade students scored proficient, compared with 52 percent in Massachusetts.

	The link between personal income and student scores on standardized tests , while well-established (proof?),  does not show up in this chart comparing states' per capital income and results on the National Assessment of Educational Progress or NAEP. One reason could be that across the nation's 10,000 school districts,  urban and suburban neighborhoods are increasingly segregated by wealth, with wealthy and poor districts within states and wealthy and poor neighborhoods within districts. Statewide comparisons won't pick up these disparities.

	Advocates of higher spending on education in California and those who argue  money doesn't matter can find evidence to bolster their position from this chart. It compares <span style="color: #000000;">state spending per student, the vertical axis, and proficiency scores on the National Assessment of Educational Progress, or NAEP, the horizontal axis. High-spending Massachusetts led the way, but low-spending Colora</span>do did as well as big spenders New Jersey and Maryland. And Utah, which spends far less, did better than New York. The District of Columbia, with a high proportion of low-income students, is a distinct outlier, with high spending and low test results. One factor alone does not drive student achievement. State policies, leadership and the equitable distribution of resources  matter at the state level; parental income and education matter, too. Per student spending is one factor in the mix.

	California's teachers have been among the highest paid since the late 1990s, although these salary figures aren’t adjusted for regional costs of living and don’t include health care and pension benefits. The average pay across the K-12 teaching profession generally has kept up with inflation. For several years before the Great Recession, California’s average teacher salary was the nation’s highest.

	In 1970, teachers made at least 75 percent more than the average income per capita for a state. But over the past 40-plus years, average teacher salaries have declined relative to a state's income per capita. The trend is sharpest in Midwestern states like the Dakotas and Wyoming.  In 1970, California teachers earned more than double the average per capita income in the state. By 2012, this had fallen to 46 percent more. In this chart, zero indicates that the average per capita income and average teacher's salary are identical.

	California spends more on teacher salaries relative to its per-student spending compared with other states. It also has one of the highest ratios of students to certificated personnel, which include resource teachers and special education teachers, along with classroom teachers. Student-teacher ratio is different from class size; the terms aren’t interchangeable.

	Over time, most states have increased expenditures and reduced class sizes from 1970, when the student-teacher ratio was between 20:1 and 24:1. High-spending states like New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts and Rhode Island have increased teacher pay and reduced the overall student-certificated teacher ratio in the state. In many states, teacher pay has kept up with inflation but not increased substantially. California stands apart with relatively low funding per student and high teacher costs. The result is that California’s ratio of students to certificated teachers has remained among the highest in the nation.

K-12 enrollment declined significantly in the 1970s and ’80s with the “baby bust” that followed the postwar baby boom, but the pattern differed by state. Enrollment in New York declined by about a million students during this period, and has not fully recovered. In Western states, as well as Florida and Texas, school enrollment soared due to migration from other states and immigration. After factoring in net declines in other states, California, Texas and Florida accounted for far more than the net growth in the nation’s K-12 enrollment.

The graying of America since 1970 has altered the ratio between students and adults, with implications for support for and funding of schools. In 1970, about 30% of the population of California was enrolled in K-12 education. Today, it’s 20 percent. In Florida and New York, it’s under 17 percent, compared with nearly a quarter of the population in Utah and Texas. California’s age demographics have shifted: in 1978 the state was similar to New York; today it is more like Texas.
